I won't focus much on this page yet because it would cater to whatever the full handbook looks like after an overhaul. Currently, it's not particularly inviting. It's not quite a "wall of text," but I'd like to explore some more visually-interesting methods of drawing in the reader. Some imagery wouldn't hurt to break up the text a bit more. 

Perhaps add some separate sections that lead into pathways to block and classic theming with quick "jump to" links at the top.
